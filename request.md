I hope you find this request for library data straightforward. Please get in touch if I need to clarify it.

These requests are for the financial year 2022/2023 (April 2022 to March 2023). I would like to receive, in computer-readable format (either Excel spreadsheet or CSV), the following:


1. The number of loans, per library branch, per month

A loan is an issue or renewal of any item from library stock, at the branch specified. Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column of: month, branch, and loan count.


2. The top 100 titles loaned for the whole year, with a count for each, including the ISBN, title, and author

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of: ISBN, title, author, and loan count.


3. The number of reservations, per library branch, per month

A reservation is a request for any item to be held for the user. The branch should be the branch that the item is requested to be picked up at.

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of: month, branch, reservation count.


4. The number of active members, per home branch, across the whole year

An active member is anyone registered on the library management system that has recorded library activity for the year 2022/2023.

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of: branch, membership count.


5. The number of visits, per library branch, and per month.

A visit is anyone counted under a footfall monitoring system. If this is done by manual survey please provide any survey data from the year, and details.

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of: month, branch, visit count.


If system limitations affect the data please provide the best alternative, with an explanation. For example, if it is not possible to provide active membership per branch, then a count for the library service, along with a reason, would be fine.

Where branch name is specified, a publicly recognisable name should be used. Where a month is listed, the YYYY-MM format would be most useful (e.g. 2022-04).

A set of 'fake data' files are available at the following link with just one sample row in each.
