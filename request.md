I hope you find this request for library usage data fairly straightforward. Please do get in touch to clarify any of the questions.

The following requests are all for the financial year 2022/2023, and should include the months from April 2022 to March 2023.

To provide an illustrative sample of the data, a set of 'fake data' files are available at the following link with one row each.



I would like to receive the following, in computer-readable format (either Excel spreadsheet or CSV).


1. The number of loans per library branch, and per month.

A loan is an issue or renewal of any item from library stock, issued from the branch specified. For renewals, the count should be assigned to the original issuing branch.

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of: month (YYYY-MM), branch, loans.


2. The top 100 titles loaned, with a count of each, for the financial year 2022/2023.

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of: ISBN, title, author, loans.


3. The number of reservations, per library branch, and per month.

A reservation is a request for any specific item to be held and reserved for the user. The branch recorded should be the branch that the item is requested to be picked up at.

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of: month (YYYY-MM), branch, reservations.


4. The number of active members, per home branch, for the financial year 2022/2023.

An active member is anyone registered on the library management system that has recorded library activity for the year 2022/2023.

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of: branch, users.


5. The number of visits, per library branch, and per month.

A visit is anyone entering the library premises (or shared premises) and counted under a footfall monitoring system. If this is done by manual survey rather than continuous monitoring, please provide the survey data and details.

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of: month (YYYY-MM), branch, visits.

If system or reporting limitations affect the data please provide the best alternative available, with an explanation of why it differs. For example, if it is not possible to provide active membership per branch, then an explanation of the problem, plus a count for the whole authority would be fine. If it is not possible the membership counts for 2022/2023 then a current snapshot would be fine, etc.
