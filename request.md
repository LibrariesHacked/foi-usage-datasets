I hope you find this request for library usage data straightforward. Please get in touch to clarify any of it.

The following requests are all for the financial year 2022/2023 (the months from April 2022 to March 2023).

I would like to receive the following, in computer-readable format (either Excel spreadsheet or CSV).


1. The number of loans per library branch, and per month

A loan is an issue or renewal of any item from library stock, issued at the branch specified. Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of: month, branch, loans.


2. The top 100 titles loaned, with a count of each for the whole year

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of: ISBN, title, author, loans.


3. The number of reservations, per library branch, and per month

A reservation is a request for any specific item to be held and reserved for the user. The branch recorded should be the branch that the item is requested to be picked up at.

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of: month, branch, reservations.


4. The number of active members, per home branch, for the whole year

An active member is anyone registered on the library management system that has recorded library activity for the year 2022/2023.

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of: branch, members.


5. The number of visits, per library branch, and per month.

A visit is anyone counted under a footfall monitoring system. If this is done by manual survey please provide the survey data and details.

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of: month, branch, visits.


If system limitations affect the data please provide the best alternative, with an explanation. For example, if it is not possible to provide active membership per branch, then a reason plus a count for the whole authority would be fine.

Where branch name is specified, the publically recognisable name should be used. Where a month is listed, the YYYY-MM format would be most useful (e.g. 2022-04).

A set of 'fake data' files are available at the following link with just one sample row in each.
