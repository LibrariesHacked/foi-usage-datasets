This is a request for data from the library service. If library services are delivered by a commissioned third party, please forward the request where necessary.

The following requests are all for the financial year 2023/2024 (April 2023 to March 2024).

I would like to receive the following, in computer-readable format, such as spreadsheet or CSV file.

1. The number of loans per library branch, and per month

A loan being an issue or renewal of any item from library stock, issued at the branch specified. Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of month, branch, number of loans.

2. The top one hundred titles loaned, with a count of each for the year

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of ISBN, title, author, number of loans.

3. The number of reservations, per library branch, and per month

A reservation is a request for an item to be held and reserved for the user. The branch recorded should be the branch that the item is requested to be picked up at.

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of month, branch, reservations.

4. The number of active members, per home branch, for the year

An active member is anyone registered on the library management system that has recorded library activity for the year 2023/2024.

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of branch, members.

5. The number of visits, per library branch, and per month.

A visit is anyone counted under a footfall monitoring system. If this is done by survey, please provide the survey data and details.

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of month, branch, visits.

For any of these, if system limitations affect the data please provide the best alternative, with an explanation. For example, if it is not possible to provide active membership per branch, then a reason plus a count for the whole authority would be fine.

Where branch name is specified, the publicly recognisable name should be used.

In all requests, where a month is entered, a YYYY-MM format would be most useful (e.g. 2023-04).
