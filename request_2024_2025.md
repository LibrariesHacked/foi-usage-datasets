This is a request for library service data. Please don't feel nervous as to the intention, it isn't singling out your library service and the data will be very useful! I am submitting requests under Freedom of Information and the Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations.

If your library service is outsourced to a third party, please obtain the data via that contract.

For all requests, I would like to receive responses in machine-readable format, such as spreadsheet or CSV file. Please do not send data in PDF files, or embed within the text of an email as this will cause unnecessary appeals. This aligns with ICO guidance for data requests.

All requests are for the financial year 2024/2025 (April 2024 to March 2025).

1. A count of loans, per library branch, per month

A loan being an issue or renewal of library stock, at the branch specified. Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of month, branch, count of loans.

2. The top one hundred titles loaned, with a count of each, for the year

Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of ISBN, title, author, count of loans.

3. A count of reservations, per library branch, per month

A reservation is a request for an item to be held for the user. The branch recorded should be the branch that the item is requested to be picked up at. Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of month, branch, count of reservations.

4. A count of active members, per home branch, for the year

An active member is anyone registered on the library management system that has recorded library activity within the year. Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of branch, count of members.

5. A count of visits, per library branch, and per month.

A visit is anyone counted under a footfall monitoring system. If this is done by survey, please provide the survey data. Suggested format is a spreadsheet with column headings of month, branch, count of visits.

For any of these requests, if system limitations affect the data please provide the best alternative, with explanation.

Where branch name is specified, the publicly recognisable name should be used rather than codes. Where a month is listed, a YYYY-MM format would be most useful (e.g. 2024-04).

I further request, in accordance with the Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2015, permission to re-use all information provided for the purpose of making the outputs available to others in a re-usable electronic form under an open licence. I request that you grant permission to re-use the information for this purpose under the terms of the Open Government Licence v3 (http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/opengovernment-licence/version/3/).
